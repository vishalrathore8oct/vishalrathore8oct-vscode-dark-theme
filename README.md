# vishalrathore8oct-dark-theme README

There are 1 versions of this theme
- **Dark Chai** (what I use)

This theme is designed keeping in mind that there are lots of teachers who teach coding and programming on youtube or their online courses. The challenges that I faced during the same are resolved in this theme such as highlighting the file name in top bar, bright token color of functions and strings for better recording etc.

It took me around 1 year to analyse all these issues and finally publish this theme.
